    <p>I am <b>Omolara Toye </b> , I'm a Nigerian lady, I've been learning Software development from capacitybay , It is fun learning new things. Although, sometimes tiring especially when i'm trying to run a code and i get error messages.</p>
    <p>It has increased my patience and also ability to think and find possible solution to the problem by surfing the internet . I'm eager to learn new things ,especially in front end development .I'm grateful to capacity bay for giving me the opportunity to scale up. </p>
